<h1>Why is my Height setting showing in centimeters on the Kardia App?</h1>
<p>The Weight "Unit of Measure" setting in the Kardia App settings, also controls whether or not the Height setting will show in Imperial or Metric (Feet vs Centimeters).</p>
<p>Check the Weight Unit of Measure setting by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Clicking on the App Menu (the three horizontal bars)</li>
<li>Clicking on Settings</li>
<li>Clicking on Weight Settings</li>
<li>Select either "Pounds" or "Kilograms" for the Unit of Measure.</li>
</ul>
<p>If Pounds is selected, the height will show in Feet.Â  If Kilograms is selected, the height will show in Centimeters.</p>
<p>This option can also be changed in the App.alivecor.com website by clicking on your email address, selecting Profile, and then on the left side of the page selecting either "ft/lbs" or "cm/kg".</p>
