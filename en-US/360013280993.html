<h1>What readings can be generated by the Kardia Instant Analysis?</h1>
<p>The following results can occur with the Kardia App Instant Analysis:<br>NOTE: These are only proven using a "LEAD I" EKG. For any other type of EKG reading, customer should not rely on the Instant Analysis reading</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>NORMAL</strong>
<ul>
<li>The heart rate is within 50-100 beats per minute</li>
<li>The app has not detected any indicators for Possible Atrial Fibrillation</li>
<li>The app determined the reading to be clean and fairly free from outside interference</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>POSSIBLE ATRIAL FIBRILLATION</strong>
<ul>
<li>The app has detected signs that the user may be experiencing an AFIB episode</li>
<li>There is a margin of error as the app has been proven to be accurate to 97% sensitivity and 98% specificity.
<ul>
<li>Sensitivity - Ability to identify those with a disease/condition</li>
<li>Specificity - Ability to identify those that specifically do not have a disease/condition</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The app determined the reading to be clean and fairly free from outside interference</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>UNCLASSIFIED</strong>
<ul>
<li>The app cannot make a conclusive determination that a customer is in either Normal Sinus Rhythm (the Normal reading) or a possible AFib episode (the Possible Atrial Fibrillation reading)</li>
<li>This reading does not necessarily mean that the customer has a health issue at that time, nor does it mean there may not be something else occurring.  It simply means that the device cannot make a determination based on what the app is designed to detect.</li>
<li>The app determined the reading to be clean and fairly free from outside interference<br><br>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>UNREADABLE</strong>
<ul>
<li>The app has determined there to be too much noise/interference detected captured by the microphone to be order to take a proper reading.<br><br>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>NO ANALYSIS</strong>
<ul>
<li>EKG readings require a minimum of 30 seconds in order to make an Instant Analysis.  Any reading between 10 and 29 seconds will prompt the customer whether they want to re-record the test, or to save it.  If they save it, it will save as No Analysis.</li>
<li>It may also be possible to get this notice due to noise or interference.  But more commonly that would appear as Unreadable.</li>
