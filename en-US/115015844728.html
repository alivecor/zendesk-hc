<h1>Do Kardia products work with a pacemaker?</h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Kardia Mobile has not been tested for accuracy with paced-EKG recordings. We do not recommend use of the Kardia Mobile for patients with pacemakers because we cannot guarantee the accuracy of the resulting EKG recordings. However, please consult with your physician for more information on using Kardia Mobile with your pacemaker.Â </span></p>
