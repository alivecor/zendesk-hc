<p>There are a few reasons why you may be getting noisy or unreadable recordings. Since KardiaMobile communicates with your smart phone via high frequency ultrasound, it is important that you keep the device within a few inches of the microphone and eliminate any sources of electric interference. Here are some of the common things to look for:</p>
<ol>
<li>Confirm your smart phone or tablet is not plugged in or charging while recording an EKG</li>
<li>Move away from sources of electrical interference such as large computer monitors or television screens</li>
<li>Try to avoid areas with environmental noise like loud crowds, or running water.</li>
<li>Be sure you don’t have headphones plugged in to your smart phone</li>
<li>If you wear hearing aids, be sure to turn them off</li>
<li>If your fingers or skin are dry, try moistening where the sensors contact your skin with some hand lotion or hand sanitizer to improve conductivity with the electrodes.</li>
<li>When recording from the hands, relax the arms and hands to reduce muscle noise. You may even rest forearms and hands on a flat surface, place the KardiaMobile EKG on the flat surface with the metal electrodes up, and let your fingers rest on the electrodes.</li>
<li>Make sure that both you and the mobile device remain still during ECG recordings. Movement during recordings will cause noise in the tracing</li>
</ol>
