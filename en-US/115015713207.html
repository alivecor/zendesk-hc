<h1>What is SmartRhythm monitoring?</h1>
<p>SmartRhythm is a system that takes your heart rate and activity data gathered from the Apple Watch, and evaluates it using a deep neural network to predict your heart rate pattern. If your heart rate differs from the neural network prediction, SmartRhythm will notify you to record an EKG.</p>
<p>Taking frequent EKGs can help you better manage your heart health, and capturing an EKG specifically during times when heart rate does not match activity levels may be useful.</p>
<p>SmartRhythm uses the Apple Watch PPG sensor to evaluate your heart rate approximately every 5 seconds. It’s deep neural network has been trained on the heart rate activity and EKG data from healthy and sick populations.</p>
<p>Receiving a SmartRhythm notification does not necessarily mean that something is wrong. There are many perfectly normal situations that can cause a SmartRhythm notification, including exercise the Apple Watch can’t detect, stress or anxiety, consumption of caffeine or alcohol, and even motion artifact from wearing the watch band too loosely.</p>
<p>Your heart rate itself depends on many factors such as activity, stress, time of day and more. So at times your heart rate pattern should be high (e.g. exercise), sometimes, it should be low (e.g. rest) and sometimes it may signify a heart problem.</p>
<p>Conversely, not getting a SmartRhythm notification does not necessarily mean that everything is normal, since the Apple Watch sensor is only measuring your heart rate and does not capture the full complexity of your heart. SmartRhythm monitoring should be used as an additional means to capture frequent EKGs. When there is a potential heart problem, either because you feel symptoms or identified by Kardia’s EKG analysis algorithms, a record of EKGs serves as actionable documentation for a medical professional to diagnose and come up with a treatment plan.</p>
<p>CAUTION: If you receive a notification to take an EKG because SmartRhythm detected that your heart rate pattern may be different from its predictions, it does not necessarily mean that you have a heart abnormality. Please call your physician before making any medical decision, including altering your use of any drug or treatment.</p>
