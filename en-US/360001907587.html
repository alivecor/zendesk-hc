<h1>How Does a User Change the Battery on Older Kardia Mobile Models? </h1>
<p>INTERNAL NOTE: These are only to be provided for users who have older devices. Most users have newer devices that have the two metal prongs. They need to be provided the new battery instructions, not these instructions.</p>
<p>-----------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>To expose the battery door at the back of the KardiaMobile, remove the KardiaMobile from the plate by placing your thumbs on the electrodes and pressing down firmly. Turn counterclockwise about 45 degrees to “unlock” the KardiaMobile. Once it’s “unlocked” the KaridaMobile can then be lifted out of the plate.</p>
<p>Using a 1.6mm Phillips screwdriver, press down firmly and turn counterclockwise to remove the screw in the battery door. Remove the used battery and replace it with a new 3V coin cell battery matched to your model. The battery is available at most general stores. Orient the battery with the positive terminal up, so that you can see the writing. Remove the protective sticker from the battery, as applicable.</p>
