<h1>Why is premium required for KardiaBand but not for KardiaMobile? </h1>
<p>While KardiaMobile EKGs are triggered only by the patient, KardiaBand includes our SmartRhythm technology that intelligently evaluates your heart rate and physical activity and sends you a notification to take an EKG. This system requires an extensive backend, continually overseen and updated by the company.</p>
