<h1>How do I take my first EKG?</h1>
<p>After your account setup is complete, when you want to record your first EKG, you will go through an introductory setup flow and take an unlock EKG.</p>
<p>For the KardiaMobile, open the phone app, and tap "Record your EKG", then choose KardiaMobile as your recording device. Move through the flow until prompted to record.</p>
<p><br>When ready, place two or more fingers (it doesnâ€™t matter which ones) from each hand on the electrodes for 30 seconds to start the timer. Hold still until the countdown completes and the recording is done.</p>
<p>For KardiaBand, make sure the app is installed on your <a href="https://alivecor.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115015801368">phone</a> and <a href="https://alivecor.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115015852348">watch</a>. Then go to your phone app, and tap the SmartRhythm card to setup your watch app. Complete the process until prompted to place your thumb on the electrode. While recording, try to relax your arms and remain as still as possible.</p>
<p>If you wear hearing aids, please be sure to turn them off when taking a recording. When you are instructed to rotate your phone, please be sure that the bottom of your phone is by your right hand and the top of the phone by your left hand.</p>
<p><em>US Only: A US board certified cardiologist will automatically review your first recording for free and provide a medical interpretation of your EKG within 24 hours. Once you receive your report notification email, you can record unlimited EKGs.</em></p>
