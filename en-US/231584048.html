<h1>Will KardiaMobile work if I only have Wi-Fi i.e. no phone service?</h1>
<p>KardiaMobile does not require cellular service. A phone that only has Wi-Fi will work fine.</p>
<p>Connectivity of some sort is required to create an account, and for U.S. users, to complete your first EKG process.</p>
<p>Once an account is complete and active,Â KardiaMobile does not require a Wi-Fi or mobile connection to record EKGs or to save it to the mobile device.</p>
<p>Connectivity is required to sync automatically with the AliveCor server, share your EKG, or print directly from Kardia app.</p>
<p>If you do not have a Wi-Fi or mobile connection at the time of the ECG recording, you can print the data later when you have such a connection and the sync will happen automatically at that time.</p>
