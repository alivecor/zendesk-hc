<h1>How does SmartRhythm affect Apple's Activity app?</h1>
<p>The Activity app will treat the SmartRhythm monitoring as a Health Activity/Workout, so it will think that you have been active the entire time your Kardia app was running. We recommend turning off the Apple Activity achievements if you donâ€™t want to be told that you worked out the entire time that you wear your watch.</p>
