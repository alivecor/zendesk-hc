<h1>What is the correct process to submit an RMA for device return or warranty exchange?</h1>
<p>Please review the correct step-by-step procedure on the following Confluence article.</p>

<p>Please see your supervisor if you are unable to access this link.</p>
<p>For International RMAs (order was placed outside of the United States or Canada), forward the ticket/request to <a href="mailto:uksupport@alivecor.com">uksupport@alivecor.com</a>Â for that group to process.</p>
<p>NOTE: While it is the UK Support Team's responsibility to work international returns, here are a few comments about how the process should work:</p>
<ul>
<li>Customers in the UK that order from the AliveCor UK store will be sent a return label via Royal Mail.</li>
<li>Customers outside the UK (not counting US and Canada of course) are directed to contact the original reseller that they originally purchased their device from.</li>
</ul>
