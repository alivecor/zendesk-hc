<h1>Why am I unable to email an EKG recording? </h1>
<p>Usually, a user is unable to email a recording because they have not set up their Iphone email application. Users will state that they are able to email from their phone, but many times they are actually using a third party application on their Iphone to send emails. For instance, the user has downloaded a comcast email app, and is emailing from this application. But the user has never setup their Iphone Email Application. Kardia Mobile has to use the Apple Email app, and if they do not have an email setup on this app, then our app cannot send emails.</p>
<p><em><strong>Internal Comment: </strong>We do not walk a user through setting up their Apple Email account, this is something that they will need to do on their own, or request help from Apple to complete. Although we can provide the following link from Apple that gives steps on how to do this. </em></p>
