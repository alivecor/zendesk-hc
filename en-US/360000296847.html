<h1>What risk is involved in lowering the sensitivity for SmartRhythm Notifications? </h1>
<p class="p1">Research has shown that capturing frequent ECGs is the best way to increase the likelihood of detecting certain arrhythmias (https://doi.org/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.117.030583).  We suggest that you take ECGs at different times during the day and especially when you feel any symptoms.  SmartRhythm monitoring should be used as any additional means to capture frequent ECGs.  We would suggest that you use the SmartRhythm notification level that you are most comfortable with as a way to remind you take ECGs.  </p>

<p class="p1">When there is a potential heart problem, either identified by Kardia’s ECG analysis algorithms or because you feel symptoms, a record of ECGs serves as actionable documentation for a medical professional to diagnose and come up with a treatment plan.</p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p1">SmartRhythm has a model that predicts what it expects your heart rate to be in the next few minutes, based on your activity level and heart rate history (see https://www.alivecor.com/technology/ for more details).  The sensitivity level adjusts how much your actual heart rate can differ from the model prediction before a notification is generated. At a lower sensitivity level, the actual heart rate will need to be quite different from the model's predictions and typically the number of notifications will reduce.</p>

<p class="p1">Receiving a SmartRhythm notification does not necessarily mean that something is wrong. There are many perfectly normal situations that can cause a heart/rate activity discordance, including exercise the Apple Watch can’t detect, stress or anxiety, consumption of caffeine or alcohol, and even motion artifact from wearing the watch band too loosely. Conversely, not getting a SmartRhythm notification does not necessarily mean that everything is normal, since the PPG is only measuring your heart rate and does not capture the full complexity of your heart. SmartRhythm monitoring should be used as an additional means to capture frequent ECGs.</p>

<p class="p1">If you decide to use the low sensitivity setting and do not get any notifications, you could use the medium setting and use your judgment on which notifications to act on to take an ECG, knowing these common factors that could cause a notification.</p>
