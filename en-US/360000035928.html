<h1>I need a referral code to connect to my doctor</h1>
<p>A referral code is not mandatory to set up your Kardia account. You can simply select "No" and proceed through the account setup process. If you were prescribed Kardia by your physician and your physician is expecting your results to be transmitted automatically to them, then you will need to contact your physician directly for a referral code.Â </p>
