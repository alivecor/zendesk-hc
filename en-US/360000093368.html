<h1>What is the difference between Kardia Mobile and a 12 lead EKG </h1>
<p>Thank you for contacting us! I would be happy to clarify the difference between the two types of EKG leads.</p>
<ul data-aura-rendered-by="403:3874;a">
<li>Single-lead EKG: Uses 2 electrodes to measure the electrical current of your heart from left to right. Kardia Mobile is a single-lead EKG that has been FDA cleared to detect Normal sinus rhythm and Possible Atrial Fibrillation. The term Single-lead EKG is interchangeable with Lead 1.</li>
<li>12-Lead EKG: Uses 10 electrodes to generate 12 different views of your heart’s electrical activity. Typically this test is done in a doctor’s office.</li>
