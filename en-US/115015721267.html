<h1>Why does the Kardia app ask me to enable my microphone?</h1>
<p>Kardia functions using an audio mechanism to transfer your EKG signal from Kardia EKG hardware, to the Kardia App on your phone, tablet, or watch. So, access to a microphone is always needed to record EKGs. This allows users to avoid any sort of pairing when setting up their device and helps the battery last years instead of days.</p>
<p>So, when you’re prompted during setup to let Kardia access your microphone, say “yes”.</p>
