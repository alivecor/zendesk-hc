<h1>Will I have to pay for a result of each EKG?</h1>
<p>No, every EKG gets an automatic and instant algorithmic result from our Kardia Instant Analysis. It can give you results like 'Possible AF' and just as important, "Normal".</p>
<p>Premium is not needed to take EKG readings and get Kardia Instant analysis results.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We do offer an optional service to additionally have your EKG sent to our Clinician Review service, where you can have your EKG read by a real life human Clinician.  Clinicians can identify many more arrhythmias that Alivecor is cleared to give. (Offerings of review types vary country to country.</p>
<p>Note: If you are a U.S. user your first EKG (and only your first) will have a delay as we process your EKG with a Board-Certified Cardiologist through our Clinician Review service, free of charge. You will be blocked from EKGs for up to 24 hours until it complets. <a href="https://alivecor.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/sections/206741388-Your-first-EKG">See here for more details</a>.</p>
