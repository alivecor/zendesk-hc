<h1>Does KardiaMobile need charging? How long will the battery last?</h1>
<p>The KardiaMobile EKG hardware does not need to be charged. The internal battery in the monitor will last 1-2 years of normal use (2-3 recordings a day). The battery may prematurely drain if a connection is continually made with both electrodes to skin or metal.</p>
