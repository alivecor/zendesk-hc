<p>Go to the main <a href="http://www.alivecor.com">www.alivecor.com</a> webpage and scroll down until you get to the section that states “Comprehensive control with Premium membership”. Go to footnote “1. USD Only” and click the link there “Click here for Premium pricing in your country.”  Refer to the chart for the international pricing.  Any country not listed on that chart will be charged in US Dollars and could possibly be charged foreign exchange fees from their credit card that they would be responsible for.</p>
