<h1>Why is the Kardia App not asking to access the microphone on my Apple iPhone running iOS 12?</h1>
<p>The release of Apple iOS 12 introduced a new feature called "Screen Time", which is designed to help track the time you are spending on their phone, as well as limit the time spent on certain apps.  Part of this software also includes new features that adds additional privacy settings to lock out certain aspects/features of the phone.  If the customer has Screen Time enabled, it may be blocking the microphone.</p>
<p>On the iPhone take the following steps to see if the Microphone is blocked:</p>
<ol>
<li>Press on the Settings Icon</li>
<li>Press on Screen Time</li>
<li>Press on "Content and Privacy Restrictions"</li>
<li>If the slider for "Content and Privacy Restrictions" is on, slide that to the Off position.  If the customer refuses to do that, scroll down to the Privacy section and make sure the "Microphone" is set to "Allow".</li>
<li>Have the customer close out of the windows, restart the Kardia App, and try again.</li>
<li>If it still doesn't work, have the customer uninstall and reinstall the app and try again.</li>
</ol>
