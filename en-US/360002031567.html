<h1>What is a Potential Adverse Event and how does Zendesk need to be coded if we receive a call to that effect?</h1>
<p>A "Potential Adverse Event", as it relates to Customer Care, is any customer contact where they claim to have been injured while using a Kardia product.</p>
<p>A common example of a Potential Adverse Event is a customer using the KardiaBand who says they developed a rash while using our product.</p>
<p>There are procedures that Alivecor must follow when dealing with a "P.A.E." so it is important that these are appropriately coded and escalated.  To that end these are the steps that <span class="wysiwyg-underline"><strong>must</strong></span><strong> </strong>be followed:</p>
<ol>
<li>The correct support code to be used is: <span class="wysiwyg-color-red">Complaint/EKG Hardware Issue/Other</span>.<br><br>
</li>
<li>The "Potential Advise Event (PAE) Checkbox MUST be checked.<br><br>
</li>
<li>The ticket must then be escalated to Level 2 Support.</li>
</ol>
<p>It is also recommended that in your subject line that you put a reference to a Potential Adverse Event.</p>
