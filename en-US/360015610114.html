<h1>A customer says that their address is not coming up as valid on AliveCor.com when trying to place an order.  Is there anything we can do?</h1>
<p>A customer does need to have a valid US physical address in order to order and ship a product from the AliveCor webstore.  There have been some situations where a customer has put in their address and the webstore has not taken it.</p>
<p>While we can't confirm this will work in all cases, we can try to use the UPS address validation tool at <a href="https://www.ups.com/address_validator/search?loc=en_US">https://www.ups.com/address_validator/search?loc=en_US</a>.  Have the customer provide you with the address they are trying to enter, and enter it into the tool.  If it comes up with a match, have them try to enter the address into the webstore exactly as it lists in the tool.  </p>
<p>Don't give this link to the customer to use since it is a UPS tool and AliveCor doesn't ship via UPS.  This is only for us to try to assist if needed.</p>
