<h1>Can more than one person use a KardiaMobile? </h1>
<p>Each KardiaMobile app is intended for one user, but others can take an EKG with a user's KardiaMobile and have it be registered as a guest. If someone intends to use the same KardiaMobile regularly to take EKGs, we recommend each user having their own Kardia account and application downloaded on their smart phone. This way their data can be kept separate from the main user's account.</p>
