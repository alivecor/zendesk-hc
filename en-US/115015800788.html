<h1>Why does my Apple Watch screen go blank while recording my EKG?</h1>
<p>By default, Apple Watch’s wake screen setting is set to remain on for 15 seconds. Recording your EKG will take 30 seconds, which is longer than the default wake screen settings. To adjust this so your watch screen does not go to sleep while recording, do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>on your phone, open the Apple “Watch” app</li>
<li>Select “General”</li>
<li>scroll down and tap “Wake Screen”</li>
<li>Scroll down to  the “On tap” section</li>
<li>Select the option “Wake for 70 seconds”.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you leave the setting set to 15 seconds you will still be able complete your recording by simply keeping your thumb pressed on the Kardia Band sensor after the screen goes black until the 30 seconds complete and you feel the haptic feedback informing you that the EKG recording is complete. You can then tap your watch face and you will see your result.</p>
<p>Setting the device to 70 seconds is preferred though so you can watch your EKG recording in real-time and get instant feedback as to the quality of your recording.</p>
