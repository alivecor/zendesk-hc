<h1>What is the difference between 'A possible change in heart rate / activity pattern was detected.' and 'Heart rate appears inconsistent with the activity level from your watch'?</h1>
<p>The SmartRhythm algorithms look for 2 different things in your heart rate data, each of which triggers one of the two notification types:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>“A possible change in heart rate / activity pattern was detected”</strong> occurs when the Watch provided heart rate changed quickly without a change in activity level. For example: Your Apple Watch’s PPG noted a sudden heart rate change from 60BPM to 120BPM but your Apple Watch’s accelerometer did not detect any activity.</li>
<li>
<strong>“Heart rate appears inconsistent with the activity level from your watch”</strong> occurs when your heart rate is outside of the predicted heart rate band calculated from your activity and heart rate history. For example: Your heart rate is sustained at 140BPM with low or no activity detected by your Watch.</li>
</ol>
