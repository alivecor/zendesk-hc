<h1> Do I need phone service or Wi-Fi to take an EKG recording on my KardiaMobile?</h1>
<p>Once logged in, our devices do not require a Wi-Fi or mobile connection to record an EKG and save it to the phone/tablet, however it requires one of these to sync automatically with the AliveCor server, email, or print directly from the Kardia app. If you do not have a Wi-Fi or mobile connection at the time of the EKG recording, you can email or print the data later when you have such a connection and the sync will happen automatically at that time.</p>
