<h1>Can you contact my provider so that I can send my EKG recordings directly to the office? </h1>
<p>If you are not wanting to email your recordings from within the app directly to the email address of your provider or their office, then we do have a cloud based platform that can be utilized. This platform is called Kardia Pro and if your physician is interested in receiving his patient's EKGs automatically to this cloud based platform, they will need to contact us directly to set up a call to discuss this. If this is an opportunity that your physician would like to pursue, please have them send an email with their information and request to Support@AliveCor.com</p>
