<h1>What does it mean if my EKG is Unclassified?</h1>
<p>You may receive a message that says “we could not classify this EKG” and tagged with the result "Unclassified". This does not mean that your recording was rejected, your recording was in-fact analyzed. What this means is that the algorithms could not classify your EKG recording as <span class="wysiwyg-underline">definitively one</span> of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Normal, with a heart rate between 50-100 BPM</li>
<li>Possible AF</li>
<li>Unreadable</li>
</ul>
<p>There could be many reasons why you received this message, from HR out of range of "Normal" to any disagreement between the algorithm results, or another rhythm type that Kardia is not cleared to communicate.</p>
<p>You always have the option to share your EKG with your physician or medical professional, or submit it for a Clinician Review directly from the Kardia app to be reviewed by a team of human clinicians.</p>
<p>Please note that the HR range only applies to "Normal" results. If a recording is considered "Possible Afib", being outside of the range will not change result, you will still be told it is "Possible Afib"</p>
