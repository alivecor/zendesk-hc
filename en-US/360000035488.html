<h1>Why is guest feature not available on Kardia Band? </h1>
<p> Guest mode on Kardia Mobile is used as a way to mark files if someone uses your phone because it is important to us to maintain correctly identified data. Since we consider the watch to be a personal device the risk of accidental data incorrectness should be less. Therefore, there is no need for the Guest EKG mode while using the Kardia Band. If someone happens to take an EKG using your Kardia band and apple watch, you do have the ability to delete this from your history on the Kardia Iphone App. </p>
