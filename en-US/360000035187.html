<h1>For Kardia Band, why isn't there an option for Roll data in a wheelchair? Why are only steps available? </h1>
<p>We use the term "step" because it is the most commonly used term when referring to any movement. When our app is gathering data from the apple health app it is gathering the movement as "other" not specifically as Steps. So roll data should be imported as other movement.Â </p>
