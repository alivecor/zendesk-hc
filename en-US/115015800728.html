<h1>My recordings from my watch have not synced to my phone. If I turn off my Apple Watch, will I lose those recordings?</h1>
<p>No, recordings are stored on the Apple Watchâ€™s storage even if you turn off your watch. When your watch and phone are near each other and have Bluetooth and/or Wifi enabled, the data will be transferred to your phone.</p>
<p>You may lose unsynced recordings if you logout of the Kardia App though, so we recommend that you verify that the recordings were successfully transferred before logging out.</p>
