<h1>How do I read the blood pressure history on the Kardia App and the Monthly Report?</h1>
<p>When reviewing your blood pressure history, there are three icons for each reading:</p>
<ul>
<li>A Black Dot - which represents the Pulse rate</li>
<li>A Colored Dot - which represents the Systolic Blood Pressure (The top number)</li>
<li>A Colored Triangle - which represents the Diastolic Blood Pressure (The bottom number)</li>
</ul>
<p>The Colored Dot and Triangle are color coded depending on the analysis that the Kardia app gave to the reading.Â  Both the dot and the triangle will be the same color:</p>
<ul>
<li>Green - Normal</li>
<li>Dark Yellow - Elevated</li>
<li>Orange - Hypertension Stage 1</li>
<li>Red - Hypertension Stage 2</li>
<li>Dark Red - Hypertensive Crisis</li>
</ul>
