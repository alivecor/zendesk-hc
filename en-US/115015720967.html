<h1>Do any third party vendors have access to user information?</h1>
<p>External contractors and companies that provide necessary services may have access to some of your information needed for processing, but do not have access to any of your Kardia Recordings or health history. The vendor which handles payment processing is a good example of this. Such vendors are required by law to protect the information we share with them.Â </p>
