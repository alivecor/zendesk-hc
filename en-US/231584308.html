<h1>Detailed Steps for Battery Replacement</h1>
<p>To replace the battery in your KardiaMobile EKG, you will need to access the battery compartment located on the back of the device. KardiaMobile may be attached to the back of your phone using a phone clip. If so, you will need to remove the device from the clip. </p>

<p>To remove your device from the clip, firmly slide it out of the open end of the clip with both thumbs. </p>

<p>It's possible for KardiaMobile to be in a phone clip without it being attached to your phone. If this is the case, follow the same steps above to remove the device from the clip. </p>

<p>The battery compartment is located on the back of the device. Turn it over and look for the round battery cover. Insert a pen, or other similarly shaped object into the notch to pop the battery cover off. </p>

<p>Replace the old battery with a new coin cell battery, <strong>3.0V size '2016'. </strong><em>These batteries can be found at most general-purpose stores.  </em></p>
<p>When installing the battery, make sure that:</p>
<ul>
<li>the protective sticker is removed from the battery (if applicable)</li>
<li>the battery is inserted with the plus sign (+) facing up.</li>
<li>Insert the battery <strong>under</strong> the two metal tabs.</li>
</ul>

<p>Now replace the cover. The single tab on the cover fits into the slot on the left side. Insert that tab first. </p>
