<h1>When will a device be on the AliveCor compatibility list?</h1>
<p>Devices are tested by AliveCor for compatibility based on overall demand. </p>
<p>This results in more prevalent compatibility toward Apple devices since an Apple iPhone is an Apple iPhone regardless of where you buy it.</p>
<p>Android phones, on the other hand, are not all built equal.  While all Android devices run a version of the Android OS software, the Android OS is typically customized by the phone developers.  Also the hardware on most Android devices varies from model to model, developer to developer.  Just because one Android device works, does not mean that all will work.</p>
<p>The Kardia devices are medical devices that, due to FDA regulations, require AliveCor to have documentation on record showing that a particular phone is able to run the app and device properly.  Because of this, it is not practical for AliveCor to be able to test every Android phone model out there.  To this end, AliveCor decides which phones to test based on overall customer demand.  If enough people request a particular phone, the likelyhood is that AliveCor will eventually test it.</p>
<p>It is also possible that devices may be tested, but not proven to be completely functional with the app and/or Kardia device.</p>
