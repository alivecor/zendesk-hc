<h1>How does a customer pay for Kardia Pro?</h1>
<p>This is setup by the physician themselves.  The doctor can choose to either have the customer pay them, or pay AliveCor directly.</p>
<ul>
<li>If the doctor has it setup to pay the practice, the customer will not have any option to enter a credit card when they enter their referral code.<br><br>
</li>
<li>If the doctor has it setup to pay AliveCor directly, the app will prompt the customer for credit card information similar to when a customer signs up for Premium service.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-color-red"><strong>IMPORTANT NOTE: If a doctor chooses to have the customer pay them directly for the Kardia Pro service instead of paying us, the doctor has the option to choose their own price for the service.  They are not bound to the $15.00 per month cost when customers pay AliveCor directly.</strong></span></p>
