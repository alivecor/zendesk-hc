<h1>What does the band behind my heart rate bars indicate?</h1>
<p>The band depicts the heart rate range that SmartRhythm predicts your heart rate should fall within based on the activity level from the Watch’s accelerometer and the past heart rate data provided by the Watch’s PPG sensor. If the Watch’s accelerometer detects an increase in your activity, the SmartRhythm will expect your heart rate to increase and prediction bands would reflect that expected increase.</p>
