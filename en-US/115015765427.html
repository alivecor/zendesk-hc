<h1>Do I need an Apple Watch with a cellular connection?</h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No, cellular ability on the apple watch is not necessary. Our app works with any Apple Watch series 1, 2 , or 3. The LTE (cellular) watch model is not required. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data is passed between the watch and paired phone using bluetooth and Wi-Fi which all models have.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The watch application, once fully setup up, can actually use all functionality independently from a phone for as long as you'd like, gathering HR, triggering notifications and recording EKGs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Any data collected will be transferred to your phone the next time your phone is nearby.</span></p>
