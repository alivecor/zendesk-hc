<div>INTERNAL NOTE ---------------------------------------------------</div>
<div> </div>
<div>We frequently get users calling in stating that they or their providers do not agree with the analysis of our algorithm, and they state that it is incorrect and want it to be reviewed by us internally. (For instance, a provider or patient is stating that a reading should be AFIb and not normal sinus rhythm)</div>
<div> </div>
<div>In the past we would ask the user for a copy of this recording, then send these cases internally to our chief medical officer for review and analysis. <u><strong>Moving forward we will no longer do this for regulatory purposes. </strong></u>
</div>

<div>
<div>If this incorrect reading involves them having to have received a paid clinician Over read, then we can refund them for the over read if needed. </div>

<div>"The algorithms used in Kardia Mobile and Kardia Band are validated to 97% accuracy that has been confirmed in multiple clinical studies. As an automated algorithm, it is one of the top available products in the marketplace. But that accuracy rate also means that there will be 3% cases where there will be errors. We continuously evaluate and improve our products and will take this particular case into consideration. We regret any inconvenience this may have caused." </div>
