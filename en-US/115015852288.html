<h1>Your 30 Day Summary Report</h1>
<p>Once a user has 30 days of data, and has subscribed to premium, a 30 day summary report will become available to them.Â This report is very popular for users as something to bring in to their physician appointments as it contains a month worth of highlighted EKGs and other longitudinal data.</p>
<p>You will see a "Download Report" button at the top of the EKG History screen in the Kardia app.</p>
<p>When viewing the report you can tap the share icon at the top right when viewing the report if you would like to print or share it.</p>
<p>Additionally, Premium members will be given the option to have monthly reports physically mailed to their home address</p>
