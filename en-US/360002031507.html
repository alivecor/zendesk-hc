<h1>Why doesn’t a customer have an option for a Clinician Review?</h1>
<p>There are a couple of reasons why a customer may not have that option available:</p>
<ol>
<li>There are only four countries that have the option to purchase clinician reviews. Refer to the following link: <a href="https://alivecor.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001888448-Which-Countries-Can-Purchase-Clinician-Reviews-">https://alivecor.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001888448-Which-Countries-Can-Purchase-Clinician-Reviews-</a><br><br>
</li>
<li>A customer that is signed up for Kardia Pro with their doctor, may not have that option.  It is determined by the physician themselves whether or not to allow their patients access to that feature.</li>
