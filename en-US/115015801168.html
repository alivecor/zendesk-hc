<h1>What type of security do you use?</h1>
<p>Our adherence to HIPAA means that all data on our servers is encrypted when it is at rest or in transit. AliveCor uses industry best practices such as AES 256-bit server side encryption for customer EKG recordings, and transport layer security (TLS 1.2) to establish a secure link with cloud servers and to encrypt data in transit.</p>
