<h1>How do I read an EKG and how does it relate to the troubleshooting of the Kardia devices?</h1>
<p>Since the Kardia devices are designed to take an EKG, it is good to know the basics what an EKG reading is and how to identify its basic components.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It is very important to note before we begin that we are not medical professionals.  As such <span class="wysiwyg-underline"><strong>it is not in our purview to give any sort of diagnosis or reading of an EKG.  We are not qualified to do so.</strong></span>  The purpose of this information is simply to familiarize yourselves with a general knowledge in case a question ever arises where this information might be useful.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So, let's first start by looking at an example graph of an EKG.</p>

<p>This looks a little complicated.  Basically, there are three main sections to a standard EKG:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>P Wave:</strong> which represents the depolarization of the atria</li>
<li>
<strong>QRS Complex:</strong> which represents the depolarization of the ventricles</li>
<li>
<strong>T Wave:</strong> which represents the repolarization of the ventricles</li>
</ul>
<p>A typical EKG cycle starts just prior to the P Wave (known as Point "O", but there really isn't a measure point for that for our purposes) and completes with the end of the T Wave  The next cycle then begins between the end of the last T Wave and the beginning of the next P Wave.  Please note however that there is also a "<strong>U Wave</strong>".  This may occur after the end of the T Wave and before the next P Wave.  At the current time there really is no confirmed specific reason for this wave.  Some EKGs may have this, some may not.  For our purposes with the Kardia devices it is only important to know that some EKGs may have this wave, and not confuse it with a P Wave which would be part of the next EKG cycle.</p>
<p>So, how does this information relate to us here in Customer Care?  There are a couple of points that are worth mentioning.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Kardia application determines the heart rate by looking at the intervals between point "R" on the EKG.  In a normal EKG point R should be the single-highest point during the cycle.  If there is interference in the EKG, with large waves that are actually artifacts and not waves coming from the user's heart, the app can mistake them as R waves.  If this happens, it can skew the heart rate and make it inaccurate.</li>
<li>Another place where this information can come in handy is with those customers that call in asking if our device registers "P Waves", or "QT Intervals" or the such.  As we all know, the app does nothing along those lines as it is designed to detect possible Atrial Fibrillation.  But you can know looking at the graph what they are referring to.</li>
</ul>
