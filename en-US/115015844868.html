<h1>Why is there a 24 hour lockout from EKG functionality after my first EKG?</h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Due to regulatory necessity, new U.S. accounts are required to have their first EKG reviewed by a U.S. board-certified cardiologist free of charge (a $19 value within the app). It will take up to 24 hours until the review is complete (although it is often much faster) and for all features to be unlocked in the application.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The entire process happens with-in the application without any extra action on your part.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This will only happen with your first EKG, all future EKGs on your account will give you a Kardia Instant Analysis, and allow you to review your EKG immediately. </span></p>
