<h1>Can Kardia Mobile or Kardia Band detect Arrhythmias other than AFIb?  </h1>
<p data-aura-rendered-by="510:9285;a">Kardia has algorithms cleared by the FDA to tell you if your EKG is Normal or in Possible AFib. As a medical device, Kardia is not cleared to detect or communicate any other arrhythmias or rhythmsÂ </p>
<p data-aura-rendered-by="510:9285;a">That being said, the Kardia devices are single lead EKGs, therefore any Arrhythmia that is present in Lead I EKG can be present in your Kardia EKG recording. To have your EKG reviewed for other arrhythmias you may share them with your physician to review.</p>
