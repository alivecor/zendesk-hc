<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You would receive this error if you are having issues with your data or internet connection, especially with certain WiFi connections.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We would advise turning Airplane mode on, then off, to help reset your connection.<br>Additionally, you can turn off WiFi to force the use of the Cellular data if using a phone with active cellular data.Â </span></p>
