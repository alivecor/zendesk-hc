<h1>My customer claims she did not get her mailed report.</h1>
<p>The mailed Summary Reports are only sent out once a month toward the beginning of each calendar month.  This would be a common question for a new Premium subscriber who might have signed up toward the middle or end of a calendar month and expects their report shortly after their 30 day cycle completes.</p>
<p>If a customer is on the Premium Trial and does not subscribe to Premium after their 30 day trial is completed, they will not receive a report.</p>
<p>The customer also needs to make sure that their physical address is entered and correct in their Profile settings of their Kardia App.  </p>
<p>Also, the mailed reports can only be mailed within the 50 continental United States.  US Territories such as Puerto Rico, US Virgin Islands, Guam, etc... cannot receive the mailed reports. (Per Pia - Ticket# 150126)</p>
