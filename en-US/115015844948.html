<h1>Is the KardiaBand hypoallergenic?</h1>
<p><span style="font-weight:400">The band is made of medical-grade silicone and the device uses non-allergenic materials -- the band has been rigorously tested to international standards for all day wear. However, some users may still find that the band causes allergies and sometimes this may be because of foreign materials being trapped under the strap.
