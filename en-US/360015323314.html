<h1>Does Kardia work if my heart rate is below 50 BPM or above 100 BPM? </h1>
<p>If you take an EKG using the KardiaMobile or KardiaBand, and your EKG is outside of the normal range which is 50 - 100 Beats Per Minute, the Kardia App will give an instant analysis of "Unclassified". This is because any EKG with a heart rate below 50 BPM is technically considered Bradycardia and any EKG with a heart rate above 100 BPM is technically considered Tachycardia. At this point Kardia products are only FDA cleared to give an instant analysis of Normal Sinus Rhythm or Possible Afib. Although, if you have a heart rate that is above 100 BPM or below 50 BPM and you are experiencing symptoms of Afib, then your instant analysis from the application will state Possible Afib and not unclassified. Our Afib algorithms are designed to always detect Afib when present, even if the user is experiencing a heart rate that is out of range.Â </p>
