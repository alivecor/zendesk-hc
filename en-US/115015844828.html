<h1>KardiaBand: Its been 24 hours since my first EKG and I am not unlocked yet?</h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have completed our first recording and the review time has passed 24 hours, it may mean that the recording did not make it to AliveCor's servers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The following steps should help you fix this issue. This process should take no longer than 5-10 minutes of your time.</span></p>
<p><strong>Set your watch wake screen to 70 seconds</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Open the 'Watch" app on your phone</li>
<li>Go to General &gt; Wake Screen</li>
<li>Scroll down to the 'On Tap' section and choose "Wake for 70 seconds"</li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Uninstall Kardia App from your watch by following these steps:</strong></p>
<ol dir="ltr">
<li>On your iPhone, open Watch App</li>
<li>​Scroll down to the “Installed on Apple Watch” section and tap on “Kardia”</li>
<li>Turn off “Show App on Apple Watch”</li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Reinstall Kardia App</strong></p>
<ol dir="ltr">
<li>On your iPhone, open Watch App</li>
<li>​Scroll down to the “Available Apps” section and tap on the “Install” button for “Kardia”</li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Re-record first EKG</strong></p>
<ol dir="ltr">
<li>Have both the watch and phone apps running and open, and logged in to your account</li>
<li>The watch app should now allow you to record your first EKG</li>
<li>​Complete your "First" ekg on watch</li>
</ol>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you follow those steps and perform the first EKG with the phone and watch app both running and near each other, it should now successfully make its way to our servers and be reviewed in a few hours (up to 24 hours).</span></p>
