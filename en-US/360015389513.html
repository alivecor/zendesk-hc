<li>If returning for a warranty exchange:
<ul>
<li>If they are still within the return window for the store they purchased from they should contact that store directly.</li>
<li>If they are outside the sellers return policy but within the 1 year warranty, the customer must provide a proof of purchase (such as a receipt) that reflects the date of purchase of the device is within the 1 year in order for us to accept the product back.
