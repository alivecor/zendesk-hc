<h1>If a customer did not receive their mailed summary report, can we send them a copy?</h1>
<p>If a customer did not receive their mailed report, our first step should always be to advise them that as a Premium subscriber they can pull 30 day reports at anytime by going to the History button.  From there they can pull a report from a specified date range of their choice so long as it spans 30 days.</p>
<p>We will sometimes though get customers that are adamant about not pulling their own reports and will demand that we send them the mailed copy.  In these cases, we need to take the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Confirm the customer's address in the My Profile settings on the Kardia App.</li>
<li>Setup your Zendesk ticket to escalate to Level 2.  In your escalation notes make sure you include the physical address that is in the customer's app.</li>
<li>If a report was generated that the customer did not receive, Level 2 will be able to confirm this and then send it to the customer as requested.</li>
</ol>
