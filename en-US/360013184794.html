<h1>When should a Complaint support code vs. a Non-Complaint support code be used in Zendesk? (as of 12/6/18)</h1>
<p>What constitutes a Complaint as opposed to a Non-Complaint has been an evolving topic.  There have been several changes made as things progress at AliveCor.</p>
<p>As of the publishing of this article, below are the guidelines for when a Complaint Code should be used instead of a non-complaint:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Any situation where a customer is not able to take an EKG, or states that they are not able to take an EKG.</strong>
<ul>
<li>This is even if the root problem has nothing to do with the EKG itself.  If they cannot take an EKG or state on the record they cannot take an EKG, a Complaint Code should be used.</li>
<li>No Signal issues are a prime example of this.<br><br>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Any situation where the issue is determined to be a Hardware failure of the Kardia device.</strong>
<ul>
<li>Most of these situations would result in a Warranty Exchange<br><br>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Any situation where a customer has purchased a Kardia device, and is unable to use it properly due to their smartphone, tablet, or watch confirmed as being incompatible with the Kardia Products.<br><br></strong></li>
<li>
<strong>If none of the above three conditions apply, Complaint should still be used if both of the below conditions are TRUE (<em>the customer doesn't have to be right in their claims</em>):</strong>
<ul>
<li>Has the user claimed on the record that we have failed in some way?</li>
<li>Does the customer believe **AND CLEARLY STATES** that the root cause is a failure or fault with AliveCor?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
