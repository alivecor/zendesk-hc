<h1>Why does SmartRhythm require my Apple Watch to be in Workout mode?</h1>
<p>Workout, or "Health and Fitness" mode is what gives Kardia the ability to get heart rates every 5 seconds from the Watch’s PPG sensor. Without workout mode, heart rates are only sampled every 10 minutes. SmartRhythm’s deep neural network can track your heart rate better with more frequent sampling by the Watch.</p>
