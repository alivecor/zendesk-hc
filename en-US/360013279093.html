<h1>Why is Smartrhythm detecting out of range heart beat ranges (the Orange bars) even though the heart beat is not outside the predicted range?</h1>
<p>Below is the official answer from AliveCor's regulatory department that we are permitted to give to customers.</p>
<p>"We recently made improvements to SmartRhythm. It now detects heart rate - activity discordance by evaluating several factors in addition to instantaneous heart rate, including changes in heart rate and consistency between heart rate measurements. Not all of these factors can be represented visually on the watch face - as a result, you will sometimes see orange bars indicating a HR / activity discordance even if your heart rate is within the bands. If you have any uncertainty about what SmartRhythm is showing, we recommend recording an ECG."</p>
