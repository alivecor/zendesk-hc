<h1>Why is the password reset link I received in my email say that it has expired?</h1>
<p>There are two reasons why a password reset link will reflect as expired:</p>
<ol>
<li>Password reset links expire 60 minutes after being sent.  If a customer waits beyond that 60 minute time frame, it will come up as such.</li>
<li>If a customer tries to submit more than one password reset request within the same 60 minute time frame, the previously submitted reset links are deactivated.  The customer would need to be absolutely certain they are clicking on the most recent link.  In a worst case scenario, recommend the customer delete any received password links and then wait 1 hour before trying again.</li>
</ol>
