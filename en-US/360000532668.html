<h1>How do I remove my consent from the app? </h1>
<p>Hi There, </p>
<p data-aura-rendered-by="863:12209;a">We have taken you off of our marketing communications list. Regarding the second of the three consents, virtually all apps, particularly those collecting sensitive health information, require some form of this consent, i.e., agreement with AliveCor's Privacy Policy and its Terms of Service.</p>
<p data-aura-rendered-by="863:12209;a">AliveCor, as do all other app providers, requires a user to agree to our Terms of Service and our Privacy Policy. Without such agreement AliveCor, like any other app developer, will not permit the use of its app. Thus, consent to the Terms of Service and the Privacy Policy is a requirement to use our app. If a user later decides he no longer wants an AliveCor account, our policy requires the user to email <a href="mailto:support@alivecor.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener" shape="rect">support@alivecor.com</a> and the account will be shut down. Alternatively, a user may simply delete the apps from his mobile devices, but this will not shut the account down.</p>
<p data-aura-rendered-by="863:12209;a">Regarding AliveCor’s privacy policy, KardiaMobile and KardiaBand are FDA cleared devices for obtaining medical grade electrocardiograms (ECG) from mobile devices. AliveCor is HIPAA compliant. We take the privacy and security of your medical information seriously. This means we follow HIPAA and HITECH regulations as set forth by U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. These require Administrative, Physical, and Technical controls to be in place. We comply with these requirements and use industry best practices to protect and secure your Protected Health Information collected through our Kardia app. AliveCor does not resell any data we receive. All personal information is removed from a user’s EKG and stored on our secure and encrypted servers. AliveCor may use de-identified EKG recordings for future clinical research and feature improvements. You can review our privacy policy and terms of service at https://www.alivecor.com/privacy/ and https://www.alivecor.com/tos/, respectively.</p>
