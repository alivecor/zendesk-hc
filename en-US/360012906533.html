<h1>KardiaBand/Apple Watch Setup Instructions - as of App Ver. 5.4.2</h1>
<p>Shown below are screenshots for a new Apple Watch/KardiaBand setup as of app version 5.4.2.</p>
<ol>
<li>From the main Kardia screen, have the user press "Get Started" on the "Setup Kardia for Apple Watch" card.<br><img src="https://alivecor.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/360018966314/IMG_0106.PNG" alt="IMG_0106.PNG" width="300" height="533">
</li>
<li>The next screen will present the user the option to watch a YouTube video on how to correctly take a Kardiaband reading.  Once they have watched the video and read the "Guard your Heart" info (recommended, but optional) they will click on "Set up".<br><img src="https://alivecor.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/360019669153/IMG_0107.PNG" alt="IMG_0107.PNG" width="300" height="533">
</li>
<li>The next screen "A few things to note" asks the user to read and confirm they understand some of the basic facts of Smartrhythm as it relates to its operation on the watch.  The user must select all three checkboxes, after which they will press "I Understand" at the bottom right.<br><img src="https://alivecor.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/360019669653/IMG_0109.PNG" alt="IMG_0109.PNG" width="300" height="533"><br><br>
</li>
<li>The next screen will instruct the customer to install the Kardia App on their Apple Watch.  The customer does NOT want to press on "App Installed" at the bottom right until they have taken this step.  <span class="wysiwyg-underline wysiwyg-color-red"><strong>At this time, no action should be taken on this specific screen</strong></span>.<br><img src="https://alivecor.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/360019670073/IMG_0110.PNG" alt="IMG_0110.PNG" width="300" height="534"><br><br>
</li>
<li>The customer is going to want to click the Home button on his iPhone from here.  From the customer's Home screen, they are going to want to find their "Watch" app and open it.  Once the Watch App is open, confirm the customer is on the "My Watch" section.  It should say this at the top as well as be selected at the very bottom of the window.  If/When they are on "My Watch", have them scroll down to "Available Apps".  They will want to then find "Kardia" and click the "Install" button to the right.  The Kardia watch app will begin to install.  As it progresses, the process circle will begin to fill in.  Once completed, "Kardia" will disappear from "Available Apps" and reappear under "Installed on Apple Watch"<br><img src="https://alivecor.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/360018968674/IMG_0111.PNG" alt="IMG_0111.PNG" width="301" height="535"><br><img src="https://alivecor.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/360019671353/IMG_0112.PNG" alt="IMG_0112.PNG" width="300" height="534"><br><img src="https://alivecor.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/360018968694/IMG_0113.PNG" alt="IMG_0113.PNG" width="300" height="533"><br><br>
</li>
<li>Once the Kardia Watch App has been confirmed installed (as shown on the last screenshot), the user should return to the Kardia app (usually by double clicking the Home button to bring up the list of open apps, and selecting "Kardia").  Back on the Kardia setup screen, the user should press "App Installed" at the bottom right of the app.<br><img src="https://alivecor.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/360018969594/IMG_0114.PNG" alt="IMG_0114.PNG" width="300" height="533"><br><br>
</li>
<li>The next setup screen is going to instruct the user to go back to the Watch App on their iPhone to adjust the Wake screen setting.  <span class="wysiwyg-underline wysiwyg-color-red"><strong>No action should be taken on this window at this time.</strong></span><br><img src="https://alivecor.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/360018969874/IMG_0115.PNG" alt="IMG_0115.PNG" width="300" height="534"><br><br><br>
</li>
<li>Once the customer is back in the Watch app on their phone (using the prior method previously described) the user is going to want to go to "General", scroll down to "Wake Screen" and press that.  When that window opens, the user will want to scroll down to "On Tap" and click on "Wake for 70 Seconds".<br><img src="https://alivecor.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/360019673153/IMG_0116.PNG" alt="IMG_0116.PNG" width="300" height="534"><br><img src="https://alivecor.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/360018970474/IMG_0117.PNG" alt="IMG_0117.PNG" width="300" height="533"><br><img src="https://alivecor.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/360018970494/IMG_0118.PNG" alt="IMG_0118.PNG" width="300" height="534"><br><br>
</li>
<li>The user will now want to return to the Kardia App (using the method previously stated), and press the "Wake screen set" button at the bottom right of the app.<br><img src="https://alivecor.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/360018970814/IMG_0119.PNG" alt="IMG_0119.PNG" width="299" height="532"><br><br><br>
</li>
<li>The next screen is going to ask you to fine tune your setup.  This is where it is going to make sure that all appropriate permissions are enabled.  If none of the permissions are enabled, there will be minus symbols next to each of the items.<br><img src="https://alivecor.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/360021608833/IMG_0185.png" alt="IMG_0185.png" width="300" height="533"><br><br>
</li>
<li>On the next screen, it will ask you to connect to Apple Health.  At the very bottom of the screen, click on "Connect".<br><img src="https://alivecor.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/360020692394/IMG_0121.PNG" alt="IMG_0121.PNG" width="300" height="534"><br><br>
</li>
<li>Once the Health screen launches, turn on the two options for Heart Rate under "Allow 'Kardia' to Write Data" and "Allow 'Kardia' to Read Data".  You can also hit the red "Turn All Categories On" link toward the top of the window.  The sliders should turn green.  Once that is done, press "Allow" in the upper right-hand corner of the screen.<br><img src="https://alivecor.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/360021605753/IMG_0124.PNG" alt="IMG_0124.PNG" width="300" height="533"><br><img src="https://alivecor.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/360020692634/IMG_0125.PNG" alt="IMG_0125.PNG" width="299" height="532"><br><br>
</li>
<li>The next screen will ask you if you to grant permission to the microphone.  You will want to hit the "Next" button.<br><img src="https://alivecor.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/360021605953/IMG_0186.png" alt="IMG_0186.png" width="300" height="534"><br><br>
</li>
<li>A screen will appear asking for "Kardia Would Like to Access the Microphone.".  Click "Ok" here.  This is required for the device to work.<br><img src="https://alivecor.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/360021606033/IMG_0187.png" alt="IMG_0187.png" width="300" height="533"><br><br>
</li>
<li>Next it will ask you to connect to "Motion and Fitness".  Click "Next" at the bottom of the screen.<br><img src="https://alivecor.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/360020693514/IMG_0188.png" alt="IMG_0188.png" width="300" height="533"><br><br>
</li>
<li>Once you hit next, it should prompt you with "Kardia Would Like to Access Your Motion and Fitness Activity".  Hit Ok. IMPORTANT NOTE: If Motion and Fitness is completely disabled, hitting next on the prior screen will take you into the iPhone settings. If it does not take you to the Motion and Fitness setting right off the bat, go to iPhone Settings.  Select Privacy and then scroll down to click on "Motion and Fitness".  Turn on the "Fitness Tracking" toggle. Likely, it will not show the Kardia app once you've done that. Unfortunately you have reached a point where you will need to force-close the Kardia app.  Once it is force closed, give it a minute and then reopen it and repeat the above steps until you get to this point.  If Motion and Fitness was properly enabled, it will then give you the proper screen.<br><img src="https://alivecor.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/360020695054/IMG_0189.png" alt="IMG_0189.png" width="300" height="534"><br><br>
</li>
<li>Next it will give a quick explanation of Smartrhythm.  Just have the user hit "Next" down at the bottom.<br><img src="https://alivecor.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/360020695074/IMG_0126.PNG" alt="IMG_0126.PNG" width="300" height="533"><br><br>
</li>
<li>Next it will ask you to Verify your Watch Setup.  Launch the Kardia App on the Apple Watch.  The following screens should appear.  Once the app is launched on the watch, go back to the iPhone screen and click "Next" at the bottom.  <span class="wysiwyg-underline wysiwyg-color-red"><strong>Make sure the watch app is launched before hitting "Next" otherwise the error in the next Step 19 might appear.</strong></span><br><img src="https://alivecor.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/360021608213/IMG_0127.PNG" alt="IMG_0127.PNG" width="300" height="533"><br><img src="https://alivecor.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/360020695314/IMG_0128.PNG" alt="IMG_0128.PNG" width="300" height="375"><br><img src="https://alivecor.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/360021608533/IMG_0129.PNG" alt="IMG_0129.PNG" width="300" height="375">
</li>
<li>If the following error below appears make sure that:<br>- The Kardia App on the watch is launched<br>- The iPhone and Watch are in close proximity to each other<br>- The iPhone has Wi-Fi and Bluetooth enabled to make sure the devices are synced.<br><img src="https://alivecor.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/360020695114/IMG_0190.png" alt="IMG_0190.png" width="300" height="533"><br><br>
</li>
<li>With any luck, Step 19 should not occur.  Ideally, this confirmation screen should appear and you can hit "Done" at the bottom.<br><img src="https://alivecor.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/360020695374/IMG_0131.PNG" alt="IMG_0131.PNG" width="300" height="533"><br><br>
</li>
<li>The last step for a new customer is to walk through their initial clinician EKG.  Of course if a customer is an existing user, the app should now launch as normal.  For a brand new account user, the following screenshots reflect what a customer will see going through the process of doing their initial clinician overread.<br><img src="https://alivecor.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/360020695694/IMG_0132.PNG" alt="IMG_0132.PNG"><img src="https://alivecor.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/360021608733/IMG_0133.PNG" alt="IMG_0133.PNG"><img src="https://alivecor.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/360021608753/IMG_0134.PNG" alt="IMG_0134.PNG"><img src="https://alivecor.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/360020695714/IMG_0135.PNG" alt="IMG_0135.PNG"><img src="https://alivecor.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/360021608773/IMG_0137.PNG" alt="IMG_0137.PNG"><img src="https://alivecor.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/360020695734/IMG_0138.PNG" alt="IMG_0138.PNG"><img src="https://alivecor.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/360020695754/IMG_0139.PNG" alt="IMG_0139.PNG"><img src="https://alivecor.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/360021608793/IMG_0140.PNG" alt="IMG_0140.PNG"><img src="https://alivecor.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/360020695774/IMG_0141.PNG" alt="IMG_0141.PNG">
