<h1>There are fields in the Premium Insights area on the Kardia App that do not appear to be a function of Kardia (ex. Diet).  How does a customer input that information into their Insights</h1>
<p>Fields in the Insights report (Premium service only) such as "Diet" are not fields that are able to be input manually via the Kardia App.</p>
<p>Those types of fields are for customers that have their Kardia app linked up to their Apple Health/Google Fit accounts.Â  Having their accounts linked up with Kardia, allows the Kardia app to capture that type of information from Apple/Google and show them on the Insights report.</p>
