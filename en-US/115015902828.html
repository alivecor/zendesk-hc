<h1>Why has my Clinician Review report not arrived on schedule?</h1>
<p>You should receive a report for your first recording (U.S. users only) or for any EKG you choose to purchase a Clinician Review for. Sometimes, the problem is that the report may be tough to locate.</p>
<p>When your report is completed, you will receive an email of completion with a link to view the report. Additionally, the report can be viewed in the Kardia app following the steps below:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open the Kardia App</li>
<li>Tap the 'History' button on the  EKG card at the top of the home screen</li>
<li>Scroll to the bottom of the list to your first EKG recording.</li>
<li>You should see green text below the recording with a result, under the heading "Analysis Reports".</li>
<li>Tap the green text to open the report.</li>
</ol>
<p>Below is an example of what a report looks like in the application, the red arrow points to where you tap to access your report:</p>
