<h1>How do I record an EKG with KardiaBand?</h1>
<p>Once the <a href="https://alivecor.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115015852348" target="_blank" rel="noopener">watch app is installed</a> , <a href="https://alivecor.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115015823487" target="_blank" rel="noopener">account created</a>, and <a href="https://alivecor.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115015721247" target="_blank" rel="noopener">watch setup</a>, press the “Record EKG” button on Apple Watch.</p>
<p>With your right hand, grasp your left hand. Rest your right thumb on the outer electrode on the Kardia Band. Push your right thumb with enough force to ensure that the inner electrode is in contact with the skin of your left wrist for the entire duration of the recording. Remain still while recording – your watch, forearm, and hands should not move while recording.</p>
<p>The recording will take 30 seconds, at which point your EKG will be processed, and you can let go of the electrode.</p>
