<h1>When I upgrade to Premium will I see all my historical recordings?</h1>
<p>Recordings taken while on a Basic membership will not be available if you upgrade to Premium membership.</p>
<p>You will always keep access your EKG data that was created while you were in an active Premium membership or Premium trial. This data will remain available in your History list.</p>
